  title: Device Management API
  description: |
    This API facilitates the management of virtual BLE devices (student/lecturer mobile phones)
    within the Zentry system, crucial for automated attendance and Face ID authentication.

    ### Key Features:
    - **Device Registration (UC-Device-01)**: Allows students and lecturers to register their mobile phones as virtual BLE devices. The system generates the DeviceToken.
    - **Device Authentication (UC-Device-02)**: Verifies if the device is the registered primary device during re-login or session validation.
    - **Device Change Request (UC-Device-03)**: Enables users to request a change of their primary device, subject to Admin approval.
    - **Device Change Approval/Rejection (UC-Device-04)**: Provides administrators with the functionality to approve or reject pending device change requests.
    - **Device Listing (UC-Device-05)**: Allows administrators to view all registered devices, including active and soft-deleted ones, with user details. Other users can view their own devices.
    - **Device Soft-Delete (UC-Device-06)**: Enables administrators to deactivate devices without permanently removing their records.

    This API ensures secure and efficient management of devices, maintaining data integrity and supporting core Zentry functionalities.
